Task 4: Optimization of Delivery Routes Using Genetic Algorithm

Your task is to apply a genetic algorithm to optimize the delivery route for a courier company. The company has a set of customers with specified locations and packages for delivery. The goal is to find the optimal route that minimizes the total cost or delivery time.

Assumptions:

1. Assume that the courier company has 10 customers, labeled as K1, K2, ..., K10. Each customer has an assigned location, which can be represented as geographic coordinates (e.g., latitude and longitude).
2. Assign a cost or delivery time to each pair of customers. For example, if you have travel cost data between customers in the form of a cost matrix, where the value in cell (i, j) represents the travel cost from customer i to customer j, you can create such a cost matrix for all customer pairs.

Steps to perform:

1. Define encoding: Create an appropriate genotype encoding that represents the delivery route as a sequence of visited customers. You can choose a permutation encoding, where each gene corresponds to a different customer.
2. Population initialization: Generate an initial population of chromosomes representing different delivery routes. The population should contain randomly generated routes. For example, generate an initial population of chromosomes representing different delivery routes. For instance, you can generate 100 chromosomes, each being a permutation of K1, K2, ..., K10.
3. Evaluate the objective function: Implement an objective function that assesses the quality of the delivery route. This could be the total delivery cost, travel time, fuel consumption, etc. The evaluation should be assigned to each chromosome in the population. For example, the objective function could sum the travel costs between customers on the route.
4. Genetic operators: Define genetic operators such as selection, crossover, and mutation, which will be applied to the population to create new generations. You can use popular techniques like tournament selection, single-point or multi-point crossover, and mutation involving city swapping.
5. Evolution process: Perform the evolution process, where successive generations of the population are generated by applying genetic operations. Then evaluate the quality of each new generation and optionally apply elitism strategies to retain the best solutions.
6. Termination conditions: Define termination conditions for the genetic algorithm. This could be a maximum number of generations, achieving a satisfactory solution, or lack of significant improvement over a specified number of generations.
7. Results presentation: After completing the genetic algorithm, present the optimal delivery route that minimizes the cost or travel time. You can also visualize the route on a map for better presentation.
8. Optimization and experiments: Conduct experiments with different genetic algorithm parameters, such as population size, crossover and mutation rates, to find optimal settings for the given problem.
9. Documentation: Prepare documentation describing the optimization process, the genetic operators used, experiment results, and the assessment of the quality of the optimal delivery route.
